# Brain-Age-Variability
A repository with information on the publication 'The influence of bio-psycho-social factors on brain age variability: a UK Biobank diffusion study (N = 35,749)'

# Components
1) Simulated data
1.1) Data frames containing region-wise and whole-brain diffusion metrics which were used for brain age predictions
1.2) Data frames containing the already calculated brain age gap and bio-psycho-social variables used in the analyses in the paper

2) Code
2.1) Brain age calculation code (using XGBoost in Python)
2.2) Analysis code (using R)
